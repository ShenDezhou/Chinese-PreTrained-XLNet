### instructions

The Chinese mainland recommends the use of Baidu cloud download points. Overseas users recommend using Google download points. The `XLNet-tiny` model file size is about **343M**. Take tensorflow version 'xlnet tiny, Chinese' as an example. After downloading, unzip the zip file to get the following results:

Relying on [hugging face transformers 3.1.0](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) The above models can be easily called.
```
tokenizer =  AutoTokenizer.from_ pretrained("MODEL_ NAME")
model =  AutoModel.from_ pretrained("MODEL_ NAME")
```

Where ` model_ The corresponding list of name ` is as follows:
|Model name | model_ NAME |
| - | - |

## Baseline system effect
In order to compare the baseline effect, we conducted tests on the following Chinese data sets. This paper compares Chinese best WwM ext, xlnet base and xlnet tiny.
Limited time and energy, and can not cover more categories of tasks, please try.

### Simplified Chinese word segmentation: MSR 2005
**[MSR 2005数据集](http://aclweb.org/anthology/I05-3017)** MSR is a Chinese word segmentation dataset published in 2005.
For details, see Thomas Emerson. 2005. The second international Chinese word segmentation Bakeoff. In procedures of the fourth sight Workshop on Chinese language processing
According to the given sentence, the model needs to give an appropriate partition, so that the words with joint meaning are combined together.
The evaluation index is ACC / F1

## Pre training details
The following takes the 'xlnet tiny' model as an example to explain the details of pre training.


### Generating Thesaurus
According to the official xlnet tutorial steps, you need to first use [Sentence piece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) Generate a vocabulary.
In this project, we use the vocabulary size of 21128, and the rest of the parameters use the default configuration in the official example.

```
SentencePieceTrainer.train(
    input=paths, 
    model_prefix='model/spbpe/spiece',  
    vocab_size=21_128, 
    user_defined_symbols=[]
)
```


### Pre training
After obtaining the above data, the pre training of xlnet was officially started.
The reason why it is called 'xlnet tiny' is that compared with the number of 'xlnet base' layers (12 layers reduced to 6 layers), the number of vocabularies has changed from 32000 to 21128, and other parameters have not changed, mainly because of the limitation of computing equipment.
The command used is as follows:
```
    from transformers import XLNetConfig,XLNetTokenizer,XLNetLMHeadModel,LineByLineTextDataset,DataCollatorForPermutationLanguageModeling,Trainer, TrainingArguments
    
    config = XLNetConfig(
        vocab_size=21_128,
        d_model=768,
        n_head=12,
        n_layer=6,
)

    tokenizer = XLNetTokenizer.from_pretrained("./model/spbpe", max_len=512)

    model = XLNetLMHeadModel(config=config)
    model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))
    print(model.num_parameters())

    dataset = LineByLineTextDataset(
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        file_path="./data/data_train.csv",
        block_size=128,
)

    data_collator = DataCollatorForPermutationLanguageModeling(
        tokenizer=tokenizer, plm_probability=1.0/6, max_span_length=5
)

    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir="./model/xlnet_v1",
        overwrite_output_dir=True,
        num_train_epochs=5,
        per_gpu_train_batch_size=32,
        save_steps=10_000,
        save_total_limit=2,
)

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=training_args,
        data_collator=data_collator,
        train_dataset=dataset,
        prediction_loss_only=True,
)

    trainer.train()

    if trainer.is_world_master():
        trainer.save_model("./model/spbpe")
```


## Fine tuning details of downstream tasks

The device used for downstream task fine tuning is Google cloud GPU (16g HBM). The following briefly describes the configuration of each task fine tuning.

## FAQ

**Q: Will larger models be released? **

A: Not necessarily, not guaranteed. If we get a significant performance improvement, we will consider publishing it.



**Q: Not good on some datasets? **

A: Choose another model or continue to pre train with your data on this checkpoint.



**Q: Will pre training data be released? **

A: Sorry, it can't be published because of copyright issues.



**Q: How long did it take to train xlnet? **

A: Xlnet tiny uses cloud TPU V3 (128G HBM) to train 30K steps (batch = 32), which takes about 8 hours.



**Q: Why does xlnet not officially release multilingual or Chinese xlnet? **

A:

(the following is my personal opinion) I don't know. Many people leave a message saying they hope to have it(https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet/issues/3)。

In terms of the official technology and computing power of xlnet, it is not difficult to train such a model (the multilingual version may be more complex, and the balance between different languages needs to be considered. Please also refer to [multilingual Bert](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md)It is described in.

**On the other hand, the authors have no obligation to do so. **

As scholars, their technical contributions are enough and should not be published or criticized, calling on everyone to treat others' work rationally.



**Q: Is xlnet better than Bert in most cases? **

A: At present, it seems that at least the effects of the above tasks are not bad, although the data used and the published [bert WwM ext](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm)It's different.



**Q: ？ **
